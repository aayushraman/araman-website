 abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms play essential roles in biological processes such as cell maintenance, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. A recent report from our laboratory showed that the loss of histone acetylation and H3K4 (Histone H3 Lysine 4) methylation in the proximal regions of cancer regulatory genes promote tumorigenesis.},
