abstract: Epigenetic mechanisms play essential roles in biological processes such
  as cell maintenance, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. A recent report
  from our laboratory showed that the loss of histone acetylation and H3K4 (Histone
  H3 Lysine 4) methylation in the proximal regions of cancer regulatory genes promote
  tumorigenesis.
