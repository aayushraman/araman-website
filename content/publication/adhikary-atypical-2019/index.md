abstract: The roles of Plant Homeodomain (PHD) fingers in catalysis of histone modifications
  are unknown. We demonstrated that the PHD finger of Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3
  Component N-Recognin7 (UBR7) harbors E3 ubiquitin ligase activity toward monoubiquitination
  of histone H2B at lysine120 (H2BK120Ub). Purified PHD finger or full-length UBR7
  monoubiquitinated H2BK120 in vitro, and loss of UBR7 drastically reduced H2BK120Ub
  genome-wide binding sites in MCF10A cells. Low UBR7 expression was correlated with
  occurrence of triple-negative breast cancer and metastatic tumors. Consistently,
  UBR7 knockdown enhanced the invasiveness, induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  and promoted metastasis. Conversely, ectopic expression of UBR7 restored these cellular
  phenotypes and reduced tumor growth. Mechanistically, UBR7 loss reduced H2BK120Ub
  levels on cell adhesion genes, including CDH4, and upregulated the Wnt/Î²-Catenin
  signaling pathway. CDH4 overexpression could partially revert UBR7-dependent cellular
  phenotypes. Collectively, our results established UBR7 as a histone H2B monoubiquitin
  ligase that suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer.
