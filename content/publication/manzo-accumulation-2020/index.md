abstract: CD8+ T cells are master effectors of antitumor immunity, and their presence
  at tumor sites correlates with favorable outcomes. However, metabolic constraints
  imposed by the tumor microenvironment (TME) can dampen their ability to control
  tumor progression. We describe lipid accumulation in the TME areas of pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) populated by CD8+ T cells infiltrating both murine and
  human tumors. In this lipid-rich but otherwise nutrient-poor TME, access to using
  lipid metabolism becomes particularly valuable for sustaining cell functions. Here,
  we found that intrapancreatic CD8+ T cells progressively accumulate specific long-chain
  fatty acids (LCFAs), which, rather than provide a fuel source, impair their mitochondrial
  function and trigger major transcriptional reprogramming of pathways involved in
  lipid metabolism, with the subsequent reduction of fatty acid catabolism. In particular,
  intrapancreatic CD8+ T cells specifically exhibit down-regulation of the very-long-chain
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) enzyme, which exacerbates accumulation of LCFAs and
  very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) that mediate lipotoxicity. Metabolic reprogramming
  of tumor-specific T cells through enforced expression of ACADVL enabled enhanced
  intratumoral T cell survival and persistence in an engineered mouse model of PDA,
  overcoming one of the major hurdles to immunotherapy for PDA.
