abstract: Recent studies have suggested that genes longer than 100â€‰kb are more likely
  to be misregulated in neurological diseases associated with synaptic dysfunction,
  such as autism and Rett syndrome. These length-dependent transcriptional changes
  are modest in MeCP2-mutant samples, but, given the low sensitivity of high-throughput
  transcriptome profiling technology, here we re-evaluate the statistical significance
  of these results. We find that the apparent length-dependent trends previously observed
  in MeCP2 microarray and RNA-sequencing datasets disappear after estimating baseline
  variability from randomized control samples. This is particularly true for genes
  with low fold changes. We find no bias with NanoString technology, so this long
  gene bias seems to be particular to polymerase chain reaction amplification-based
  platforms. In contrast, authentic long gene effects, such as those caused by topoisomerase
  inhibition, can be detected even after adjustment for baseline variability. We conclude
  that accurate characterization of length-dependent (or other) trends requires establishing
  a baseline from randomized control samples.
