abstract: Clinical trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of forniceal
  deep brain stimulation (DBS) for improvement of memory in Alzheimer's patients,
  and forniceal DBS has been shown to improve learning and memory in a mouse model
  of Rett syndrome (RTT), an intellectual disability disorder caused by loss-of-function
  mutations in MECP2. The mechanism of DBS benefits has been elusive, however, so
  we assessed changes in gene expression, splice isoforms, DNA methylation, and proteome
  following acute forniceal DBS in wild-type mice and mice lacking Mecp2. We found
  that DBS upregulates genes involved in synaptic function, cell survival, and neurogenesis
  and normalized expression of ~25% of the genes altered in Mecp2-null mice. Moreover,
  DBS induced expression of 17-24% of the genes downregulated in other intellectual
  disability mouse models and in post-mortem human brain tissue from patients with
  Major Depressive Disorder, suggesting forniceal DBS could benefit individuals with
  a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.
