abstract: Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS) has been identified
  as an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by a complex neurological phenotype,
  with high prevalence of intellectual disability and optic nerve atrophy/hypoplasia.
  The syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in NR2F1, which encodes a highly
  conserved nuclear receptor that serves as a transcriptional regulator. Previous
  investigations to understand the protein's role in neurodevelopment have mostly
  used mouse models with constitutive and tissue-specific homozygous knockout of Nr2f1.
  In order to represent the human disease more accurately, which is caused by heterozygous
  NR2F1 mutations, we investigated a heterozygous knockout mouse model and found that
  this model recapitulates some of the neurological phenotypes of BBSOAS, including
  altered learning/memory, hearing defects, neonatal hypotonia and decreased hippocampal
  volume. The mice showed altered fear memory, and further electrophysiological investigation
  in hippocampal slices revealed significantly reduced long-term potentiation and
  long-term depression. These results suggest that a deficit or alteration in hippocampal
  synaptic plasticity may contribute to the intellectual disability frequently seen
  in BBSOAS. RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed significant differential gene
  expression in the adult Nr2f1+/- hippocampus, including the up-regulation of multiple
  matrix metalloproteases, which are known to be critical for the development and
  the plasticity of the nervous system. Taken together, our studies highlight the
  important role of Nr2f1 in neurodevelopment. The discovery of impaired hippocampal
  synaptic plasticity in the heterozygous mouse model sheds light on the pathophysiology
  of altered memory and cognitive function in BBSOAS.
