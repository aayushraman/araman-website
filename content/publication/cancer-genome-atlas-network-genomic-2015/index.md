abstract: 'We describe the landscape of genomic alterations in cutaneous melanomas
  through DNA, RNA, and protein-based analysis of 333 primary and/or metastatic melanomas
  from 331 patients. We establish a framework for genomic classification into one
  of four subtypes based on the pattern of the most prevalent significantly mutated
  genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type). Integrative
  analysis reveals enrichment of KIT mutations and focal amplifications and complex
  structural rearrangements as a feature of the Triple-WT subtype. We found no significant
  outcome correlation with genomic classification, but samples assigned a transcriptomic
  subclass enriched for immune gene expression associated with lymphocyte infiltrate
  on pathology review and high LCK protein expression, a TÂ cell marker, were associated
  with improved patient survival. This clinicopathological and multi-dimensional analysis
  suggests that the prognosis of melanoma patients with regional metastases is influenced
  by tumor stroma immunobiology, offering insights to further personalize therapeutic
  decision-making.'
