abstract: Histone methyltransferase KMT2D harbors frequent loss-of-function somatic
  point mutations in several tumor types, including melanoma. Here, we identify KMT2D
  as a potent tumor suppressor in melanoma through an inÂ vivo epigenome-focused pooled
  RNAi screen and confirm the finding by using a genetically engineered mouse model
  (GEMM) based on conditional and melanocyte-specific deletion of KMT2D. KMT2D-deficient
  tumors show substantial reprogramming of key metabolic pathways, including glycolysis.
  KMT2D deficiency aberrantly upregulates glycolysis enzymes, intermediate metabolites,
  and glucose consumption rates. Mechanistically, KMT2D loss causes genome-wide reduction
  of H3K4me1-marked active enhancer chromatin states. Enhancer loss and subsequent
  repression of IGFBP5 activates IGF1R-AKT to increase glycolysis in KMT2D-deficient
  cells. Pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis and insulin growth factor (IGF)
  signaling reduce proliferation and tumorigenesis preferentially in KMT2D-deficient
  cells. We conclude that KMT2D loss promotes tumorigenesis by facilitating an increased
  use of the glycolysis pathway for enhanced biomass needs via enhancer reprogramming,
  thus presenting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention through glycolysis or
  IGF pathway inhibitors.
