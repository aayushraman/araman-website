abstract: Antiviral responses must be tightly regulated to defend rapidly against
  infection while minimizing inflammatory damage. Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are crucial
  mediators of antiviral responses and their transcription is regulated by a variety
  of transcription factors; principal among these is the family of interferon regulatory
  factors (IRFs). The IRF gene regulatory networks are complex and contain multiple
  feedback loops. The tools of systems biology are well suited to elucidate the complex
  interactions that give rise to precise coordination of the interferon response.
  Here we have used an unbiased systems approach to predict that a member of the forkhead
  family of transcription factors, FOXO3, is a negative regulator of a subset of antiviral
  genes. This prediction was validated using macrophages isolated from Foxo3-null
  mice. Genome-wide location analysis combined with gene deletion studies identified
  the Irf7 gene as a critical target of FOXO3. FOXO3 was identified as a negative
  regulator of Irf7 transcription and we have further demonstrated that FOXO3, IRF7
  and IFN-I form a coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit. Our data suggest that
  the FOXO3-IRF7 regulatory circuit represents a novel mechanism for establishing
  the requisite set points in the interferon pathway that balances the beneficial
  effects and deleterious sequelae of the antiviral response.
