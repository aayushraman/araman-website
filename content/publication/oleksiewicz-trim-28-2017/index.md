abstract: Reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiation
  of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are regulated by epigenetic machinery. Tripartite
  motif protein 28 (TRIM28), a universal mediator of Krüppel-associated box domain
  zinc fingers (KRAB-ZNFs), is known to regulate both processes; however, the exact
  mechanism and identity of participating KRAB-ZNF genes remain unknown. Here, using
  a reporter system, we show that TRIM28/KRAB-ZNFs alter DNA methylation patterns
  in addition to H3K9me3 to cause stable gene repression during reprogramming. Using
  several expression datasets, we identified KRAB-ZNFs (ZNF114, ZNF483, ZNF589) in
  the human genome that maintain pluripotency. Moreover, we identified target genes
  repressed by these KRAB-ZNFs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these KRAB-ZNFs
  directly alter gene expression of important developmental genes by modulating H3K9me3
  and DNA methylation of their promoters. In summary, TRIM28 employs KRAB-ZNFs to
  evoke epigenetic silencing of its target differentiation genes via H3K9me3 and DNA
  methylation.
