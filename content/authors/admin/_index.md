<span style="color:red">**I am currently on the job market!**</span>I am a Postdoc Associate at [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://broadinstitute.org/) and affiliated with [Dana Farber Cancer Institute](https://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/) & [MGH, Harvard Medical School](https://www.massgeneral.org/pathology/research). I am working with the labs of [Martin Aryee](https://aryee.mgh.harvard.edu/), [Alex Meissner](https://hscrb.harvard.edu/people/alexander-meissner/), and [Andi Gnirke](https://www.broadinstitute.org/epigenomics/team) to understand the dynamics of gene regulation using single-cell genomics.  

I earned my Ph.D. in Quantitative and Computational Biosciences at the [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/education/graduate-school-of-biomedical-sciences/programs/quantitative-computational-biosciences), where I worked with [Zhandong Liu](http://liuzlab.org/) and [Huda Zoghbi](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs-and-centers/faculty-labs/huda-zoghbi-lab) focused on batch effects in NGS datasets, reproducibility & meta-research, and also worked with [Kunal Rai](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/rai-laboratory.html) in the field of the cancer epigenomics. Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I worked as a Bioinformatics Scientist at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://isbscience.org/), Seattle.

I completed my MS in Computational Biology from [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/) and did my undergrad at [Vellore Institute of Technology](https://vit.ac.in/), where I earned B.Tech in Bioinformatics.
